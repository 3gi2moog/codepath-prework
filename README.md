- An app that I want to build is a calorie tracker app that provides accurate calorie measurements based on the weight input. Additionally, it would provide a vitamin and nutrient profile, and suggest foods that can supplement the ones that are lacking. Most important, I want this app to show long time trends and is able to average out weeks, and give brief summaries in the form of charts and text to help the users reach their fitness goals.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    My challenges building this app was becoming accustomed to the layout of Xcode and where to find certain buttons, like Run, assistant, etc. After finding them, it was easier to get the hang of things.
